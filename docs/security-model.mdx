Ory has a proven security model which can take a moment to get used to. Compared to other solutions, Ory manages sessions, tokens,
and cookies for you whenever possible. You do not need to worry about refreshing tokens or figuring out whether to store them in
`localStorage` or `document.cookies`. Instead, Ory solves all of this for you and deploys best-in-class protections for common
browser attack vectors (XSS, CSRF, ...).

## Ory's Identity Service Need Access to Your Domain

Ory bears the responsibility of managing sessions, cookies, and tokens for you. To do this, Ory needs to be exposed on your
domain, otherwise HTTP Cookies will not be sent. Per default, Ory's APIs are available at

```
https://<project-slug>.projects.oryapis.com
```

Let's say you are developing an app and it runs on `http://localhost:3000`. For Ory to be able to manage the session information,
it needs to be able to set an HTTP Cookie for `domain=localhost` as well! The same applies when your app runs in production (for
example on `https://app.example.org`). Here too Ory needs to be able to set the HTTP Cookie for `domain=example.org`:

1. During **development** you use the [Ory Tunnel on your machine](guides/local-development.mdx) to "mirror" the APIs available at
   `https://<project-slug>.projects.oryapis.com` on your `localhost` domain. Ory offers SDKs for certain deployment options such
   as [Vercel](guides/protect-page-login/nextjs.mdx) which mirror Ory's APIs without the need of running another process.
2. For **production** you set up a [Custom Domain](guides/custom-domains.mdx) (for example `https://ory.example.org`) which makes
   Ory's APIs available at `https://ory.example.org`.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Below we have collected some frequently asked questions about Ory's security model.

### How do I solve CSRF Issues?

### What about OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect?

Ory has an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect product currently available as self-hosted open source under the name of
[Ory Hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra). Ory thus supports OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, but only recommends it for targeted use
cases. If you haven't, read
[Why you probably do not need OAuth2 / OpenID Connect](https://www.ory.sh/oauth2-openid-connect-do-you-need-use-cases-examples/).

### What about Access Tokens / Refresh Tokens?

Ory has an OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect product which can generate Access and Refresh Tokens. Unless
[you need OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect](https://www.ory.sh/oauth2-openid-connect-do-you-need-use-cases-examples/), Ory's Security
Model is a much easier solution to handle.

### What about JSON Web Tokens?

There is an [open issue to support JSON Web Tokens](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2487) for Ory's Identity Service.
